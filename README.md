# DailyChecklist

### Currently Ongoing Project and is in initial stages

A To-Do application with following features (some features are still under work) : 
- [x] Resetable List which resets *all or some* of the checklist items depending on the time specified
- [ ] Probably, the first checklist app, which displays multiple checklists on *dashboard* in form of *Collection View* instead of *Table View* 
- [x] Prioritize different checklists


### To-do list for To-do list (Pun Intended :sweat_smile:)
- [x] Re-arrange Checklists on dashboard and remember the order
- [ ] While adding and removing items from checklist, automatically *add or delete* new rows i.e. as soon as the user starts typing new item in checklist , a new row will be created below it and when the user deletes all the text that was entered, the previously added row will be deleted
- [ ] Set a reminder for a checklist via *Local Notifications*
