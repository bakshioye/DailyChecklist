# DailyChecklist

**Currently Ongoing Project and is in initial stages** 

**Note:** 
- Strike-Through points means they are completed
- Points in bold means i am currenlt working on them


A To-Do application with following features (some features are still under work) : 
1. ~~Resetable List which resets *all or some* of the checklist items depending on the time specified~~
1. Probably, the first checklist app, which displays multiple checklists on *dashboard* in form of *Collection View* instead of *Table View* 
#### 3. Prioritize different checklists


To-do list for To-do list (Pun Intended :sweat_smile:)
1. Re-arrange Checklists on dashboard and remember the order
1. While adding and removing items from checklist, automatically *add or delete* new rows i.e. as soon as the user starts typing new item in checklist , a new row will be created below it and when the user deletes all the text that was entered, the previously added row will be deleted
1. Set a **reminder** for a checklist via *Local Notifications*
